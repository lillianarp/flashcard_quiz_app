# Flashcard Quiz App

## Project Overview

This Flashcard Quiz App is a learning project to help develop my skills in Python, particularly with Python dictionaries and their use in functions. The app is the foundation for a more robust language learning tool, specifically designed to teach the Samoan language.

## Purpose

This project creates an interactive flashcard quiz application that helps users learn new vocabulary. The initial focus is on the Samoan language, but the framework is designed to be extensible to other languages in the future.

## Features

- **Interactive Flashcards:** Users can engage with flashcards to learn and test their knowledge.
- **Python Dictionaries:** The app makes extensive use of Python dictionaries to store and manage flashcard data.
- **Function-Based Logic:** Core functionalities are encapsulated in functions, promoting modularity and reusability.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I've gained deeper insights into:
- Creating and manipulating Python dictionaries.
- Implementing application logic using functions.
- Structuring a Python project for scalability.

## Next Steps

### Embedding in Website

The next steps for this project involve embedding the flashcard app into my website (gagana-samoa.com). I'm considering two main approaches:

1. **Back End Development:**
   - Developing a web application using a framework such as Flask or Django.
   - Hosting the Python logic on a server and integrating it with a front-end interface.

2. **AI Chatbot Integration:**
   - Using a low-code platform like Voiceflow to create an AI-powered chatbot.
   - Integrating the existing Python script via APIs to offer the quiz through the chatbot on the website.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system. You can check your Python version by running:
```sh
python --version
```

### Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flashcard-app.git
   cd flashcard-app
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - On Windows:
     ```sh
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```sh
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the App

Run the Python script to start the flashcard quiz:
```sh
python app.py
```
